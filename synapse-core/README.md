## 🔭 Overview

**SYNAPSE** is a specialized Execution Environment that bridges the generative power of the AI Agent Workstation with external platforms (TikTok API).

The application eliminates human error during the publication phase. It receives approved content "packages," validates them against technical and brand standards, and holds them in a secure queue until the "micro-moment" of maximum audience engagement.

---

## 🏗 Architecture

The system operates as a one-way data gateway:
`AI Workstation` -> `SYNAPSE Ingestion` -> `Validation Core` -> `Secure Queue` -> `Public API`

![System Architecture](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Architecture+Diagram+Placeholder)
*(Data Flow: From Ingestion to Reporting Loop)*

### Package Lifecycle:
1.  **Ingestion:** Receipt of JSON payload and media files.
2.  **Validation:** Verification of hash sums and metadata.
3.  **Scheduling:** Algorithmic calculation of launch time.
4.  **Execution:** Autonomous API call.
5.  **Reporting:** Transaction confirmation.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **🛡️ Fail-Secure Logic**
    If any data integrity violation occurs or the engineer's signature hash mismatches, publication is blocked. The system never posts corrupt or unauthorized content.
* **⏱️ Chrono-Scheduler**
    A dynamic queue operating not on static schedules, but on Real-time audience activity triggers. Execution precision within 500ms.
* **🤖 Full Autonomy**
    "Zero-Touch" mode. Once the strategy is approved, no human intervention is required.
* **✅ Smart Validation**
    Automatic checks for Safe Zones (TikTok interface areas), bitrate, and compliance rules before upload.

## 💻 Tech Stack

* **Runtime:** Python 3.11+ (AsyncIO)
* **Queue Management:** Redis / RabbitMQ
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Transactions), TimeScaleDB (Analytics)
* **Integrations:** Official TikTok Content Posting API
* **Containerization:** Docker (Alpine Linux base)

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.11+
* Redis Server
* Access to TikTok Developer App (Client Key & Secret)

### Local Development

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone [https://github.com/company/synapse-core.git](https://github.com/company/synapse-core.git)
cd synapse-core

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# (Fill .env with your API keys)

# 5. Run module in debug mode
python main.py --mode=debug
🔐 Security Protocols
SYNAPSE employs a strict security model.

Environment Variables (.env)
Ini, TOML

TIKTOK_CLIENT_KEY=xxxx
TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxx
ENGINEER_pub_KEY_PATH=/certs/engineer_verify.pem
KILL_SWITCH_TOKEN=very-long-secret-token
Emergency Kill-Switch
In an emergency, the engineer can freeze the queue with a single command:

Bash

curl -X POST https://synapse-internal/api/v1/emergency/stop \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $KILL_SWITCH_TOKEN"
📡 API Reference
Example incoming payload (from AI Agent):

JSON

POST /api/v1/ingest
